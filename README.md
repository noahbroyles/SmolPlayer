# SmolPlayer
I forked this awesome little Youtube music app to make even more hawt. You know what bugs me though? _Github doesn't count contributions to a **fork!**_ I was **ssed.

If you want to install this app on your mac, just make sure you have the VLC media player app installed first. This app will not work without VLC. ;)

You can download the DMG to install this as a MacOS Application *along with* VLC from [noahbroyles.club/smolplayer](https://noahbroyles.club/smolplayer.html)

And oh by the way, this being intended to run as a standalone MacOS app, the compatibity with Windows might just *not be there*. Well actually, the only thing I know of that **won't** work in Windows is the `touch` commands down at the bottom.
If you are trying to run this on Windows, just make sure you have two emtpy txt files, `songlist.txt` and `urllist.txt` in the same folder as `SmolPlayer.py`.
